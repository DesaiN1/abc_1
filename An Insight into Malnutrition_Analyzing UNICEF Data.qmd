## INTRODUCTION

Childhood malnutrition is a major public health concern around the
world, with many children suffering from undernutrition and obesity.

[Malnutrition]{style="color: blue;"} is defined as "***a state of
nutrition in which a deficiency or excess (or imbalance) of energy,
protein, and other nutrients causes measurable adverse effects on
tissue/body form (body shape, size, and composition) and function and
clinical outcome***" (World Health Organization, 2019).

A child's brain, body, and immune system grow and develop rapidly during
the first [five years]{style="color: blue;"} of life, and good nutrition
is critical to ensuring that this growth and development occurs
normally. Malnutrition during this period can have long-term effects on
a child's health, cognitive development, and future productivity, which
can last into adulthood. Furthermore, children under the age of five are
especially vulnerable to malnutrition because their bodies are still
developing and they have higher nutrient needs relative to their body
size than older children and adults. As a result, addressing
malnutrition in children under the age of five is critical for ensuring
healthy development and future well-being.

In this report, we will look at the [prevalence of BMI for age \<-1
SD]{style="color: red;"} in children under the age of five in different
countries between the years 1991-2020. Using data from UNICEF indicators
and metadata, we will visualize different factors that have affected
child malnutrition.

## 25 COUNTRIES WITH HIGHER BMI OBS. VALUE \<- 1 SD

A BMI-for-age less than -1 standard deviation indicates that the child
is underweight. High observation values for BMI \<- 1 SD in children
under age 5 years are concerning, as they can have serious long-term
health consequences and can impact the overall health and well-being of
a population.

![](1.Top%2025%20Countries%20with%20the%20BMI%20Value%20less%20than%201%20SD.png)

From the world Map Plot, we can see that most of the African and a few
countries in Asian and South America have high observation value. The 25
countries shown on the map have high prevalence of under-nutrition among
children under the age of 5. What can be inferred:

*-* Countries may have inadequate access to nutritious food, clean
water, sanitation, and healthcare services, which can contribute to
under-nutrition.

*-* Under-nutrition in early childhood can lead to long-term health
consequences, including stunted growth, weakened immune systems, and
developmental delays.

*-* Addressing under-nutrition in these countries should be a priority
for policymakers and stakeholders to ensure children have a healthy
growth and development.

## Population & Life Expectancy by Observed Value

The world population has increased in the last few decades and it
estimated to keep growing in future. We have reached 8 Billion mark with
India and China being the highly populated countries.

![](2.%20Population%20and%20Life%20Expectancy%20by%20Observed%20Value.png)

From the above plot, we can see that Population and Life expectancy have
a positive slope. Prominently, in the developing countries, due to
growing economy, medical advancement and changing lifestyle.

## Time Series Chart of Obs. Value for Country by Time Period

A time series chart can show how the the trend has changed over a
certain period of time. In this current graph, the number of observed
values in the year 1991 to 2020 have been plotted to find some trends
and analyse it further.

![](3.%20Time%20Series%20Chart%20of%20Obs.%20Value%20for%20Country%20by%20Time%20Period.png)As
can be inferred from the scatter plot, We can see a drop in the number
of observation values in the year 2020 compared to previous years.

Awareness among countries and governments have played a major role here.
Policies like Breastfeeding Promotion, Food Fortification, Nutrition
Education, School Feeding Programs, Agricultural and Food production
Policies and Social protection have helped reduce the number of
Malnourished children around the world.

## Smooth Trend Line on the Time Series Chart

By plotting a Smooth Trend line, we can see that the observed values had
a peak in the years 2000 and 2010 but then it starts to reduce later
till 2020. As mentioned above, the policies have helped reduce
malnutrition significantly.

## Bar Graph Plot showing 20 countries with the lowest observed Values

The following Bar graph shows the bottom 20 countries with the lowest
observed values from the UNICEF Data. Over the years, **SDG Goal 2. Zero
Hunger** has been considered to have played a major role in reducing
malnutrition.

## How can we accelerate these Programs and Policies to reduce Malnutrition?

1.  Increase funding: Adequate funding is necessary for implementing
    effective programs to tackle malnutrition. Governments,
    international organizations, and donors should allocate more
    resources towards nutrition programs.

2.  Empower women and girls: Improving the nutrition status of women and
    girls is critical to breaking the cycle of malnutrition. Efforts
    should be made to promote girls' education, increase their access to
    healthcare, and empower women through income-generating activities.

3.  Improve access to nutritious food: Access to nutritious food is
    crucial to combat malnutrition. Governments should invest in
    programs that promote food security, such as subsidized food
    programs, school feeding programs, and community gardens.

4.  Strengthen health systems: Health systems play a critical role in
    delivering nutrition services. Governments should prioritize the
    strengthening of health systems, including the training of
    healthcare workers and the improvement of infrastructure and
    equipment.

5.  Raise awareness: Raising awareness about the consequences of
    malnutrition and the importance of proper nutrition is crucial to
    accelerating progress. Governments should invest in public education
    campaigns that promote healthy eating habits and increase awareness
    about the importance of good nutrition.
